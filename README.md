# CS370-PirateTrainingAI

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

In this project, I needed to train an AI pirate to traverse a randomly generated 8 x 8 maze and have it reach an endpoint where a treasure was located at. I was given a framework of code to start with and I had to develop the code responsible for training the AI in this scenario.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?** 

In a nutshell, computer scientists build solutions and solve problems related to software. Depending on the area of expertise this can range from mobile/web development to cybersecurity and AI. As digitial technology continues to make our lives easier, we need people such as computer scientists to build upon and and improve these solutions so that our lives can become even easier over time. An example of technology I like to use is AI that is trained to detect cancer by x-ray readings. This AI is incredibly accurate and can save doctors time and resources to devote to other tasks. It can also help save lives since these can help detect cancer in its early stages leading to more deaths being prevented.    

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?** 

As a computer scientist, I look at how a solution not only fixes the problem at hand, but whether the proposed solution satisfies the business requirements and fits with the overall system. I also try to consider the trade offs involved. A solution that is optimized for performance might be difficult to alter if the business requirements change. Or a proposed solution that works effectively with one specific framework might not work as effectively when a different framework needs to be used. It is all about considering the trade offs involved.    

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?** 

As a software developer, I need to ensure that the code I write benefits the end user. This means ensuring that the code written is secure, user friendly and easily available for all end users. For the organization, I need to ensure that the code I write meets their business needs and adds values to the program. It should be efficient, clean and free of bugs and have a positive impact.
